  <h1>Thanks for using MusicNotes!</h1>
  <p>Step 1: Press the 'draw staves' button or just hit the space-bar! This
   will draw some staves on the page.</p>
   <p>Step 2: Use your keyboard or the buttons on screen to input notes.</p>
   <p>Pressing 'zxcvbnm' will make a C scale from C to B in the third octave.
   These are very low notes and mostly in the vocal range of
   the average dude.</p>
   <p>Pressing 'asdfghj' will make a C scale from C to B in the fourth octave.
   These are higher notes which pretty much
   cover the vocal range of an average woman.</p>
   <p>Pressing 'qwertyu' will make a C scale from C to B in the fifth octave.
   These are high notes. A skilled soprano could sing them mostly,
   but better to get your hands on a flute.</p>
   <p>Pressing '1234567' will make a C scale from C to B in the sixth octave.
   These are super high notes. Don't even go there.</p>
   <p>Step 3: press delete to delete your whole song and start over.</p>
   <p>There is no way to save other than just taking a screenshot.</p>
