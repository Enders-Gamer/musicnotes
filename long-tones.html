    <H1>Long Tones</H1>
    <P>You need to make long tones a priority. You need to make long tones a thing. It has to happen.
        You have to play long long, tones and just essentially think of yourself as driving a car a long distance...
        Like a truck driver delivering logs 100 miles</P>
