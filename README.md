# MusicNotes

Aaron's music notation software.

This program is meant to be a notation app that is not so much for engraving and publishing as it is for practicing your composition skills and sight-reading.

It is meant to fit nicely in any screen although so far it is optimized for my phone, Galaxy s7. When I say optimized I mean it kind of fits for now.

Eventually it will resize the canvas based on window size and repopulate staves and auto-determine measures per line and the like, which I am aware is really complex. For now I am perfectly satisfied to display some note heads on the screen and have buttons that place and move and remove them.

Eventually I want to be able to compose using only the keyboard. Notation software like MuseScore and Finale (the two with which I am somewhat familiar) relies heavily on the mouse. I know both of these programs can interface with a piano keyboard via USB, but excepting that... one should be able to compose with only a computer keyboard.
